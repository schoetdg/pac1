            <h3>Recent Key Highlights</h3>
            <div class="">
              <ol>
        <li><strong>Interagency began a series of workshops for prioritizing NBIB investigative backlog reductions recommendations</strong>.  In August, representatives from DoD, ODNI, OPM, NBIB, and the PAC PMO began meeting to review a number of proposed changes to reduce NBIB&rsquo;s investigation backlog. These workshops, which are expected to conclude in October, will lead to a number of the recommendations being approved by the Executive Agents for implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>ODNI Continuous Evaluation System cleared a review hurdle.</strong>  Continuous Evaluation (CE) is an automated capability to determine whether already cleared personnel have adverse information reported against them through repeated database checks. The ODNI&rsquo;s CE system passed an Operational Readiness Review in August, which allows the agency to offer the capability the broader personnel vetting community.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Services for performing adjudications becomes available to NBIB customer agencies.</strong> In September, NBIB deployed an automated adjudication determination capability for cases where no adverse information was identified during a Tier 1 and Tier 3 investigation. This advancement will permit NBIB customers, which make up about 95% of Executive Branch agencies, to avoid the time and cost associated with a human adjudicating these cases. The Government hopes to expand this capability in the future.</li>

              <P>The PAC’s vision for the future state falls into four primary Work Streams: Trusted Workforce, Modern Vetting, Secure and Modern Mission-Capable IT, and Continuous Performance Improvement. </P>
<br>
        <h5>Trusted Workforce</h5>
<p>We must equip our workforce with the necessary training and resources to assist the workforce in responsibly reporting and/or self-reporting information of potential concern. </p>
<h5>Modern Vetting</h5>
<p>We must modernize our SSC vetting policies, processes, and workforce to reduce waste, increase quality, enhance effectiveness, and improve efficiency.  </p> 
<h5>Secure and Modern Mission-Capable IT</h5>
<p>We must secure the end-to-end environment, enhance SSC IT systems, establish SSC end-to-end shared services, and treat SSC data as a shared asset to support aligned, modern, and secure SSC IT systems and data. </p>

<h5>Continuous Performance Improvement</h5>
<p>We must establish a continuous performance improvement model and institutionalize outcome-based performance metrics to identify and drive enterprise-level enhancements to policy, oversight, and operational processes. </p>
